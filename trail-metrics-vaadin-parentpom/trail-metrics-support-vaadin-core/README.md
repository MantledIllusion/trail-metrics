# trail-measurements-support-vaadin-core

Offers a base implementation of a Vaadin _**MetricsTrail**_ support that is used by more specific implementations for each Vaadin platform.

It is **not** meant to be used in an application; instead, the correct support for the Vaadin platform used in the application should be utilized.
